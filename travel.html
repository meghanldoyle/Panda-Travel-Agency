		<!--This is my second paragraph
			I talk more about the Cathedral Beaches-->
		<p>The Cathedrals Beach main attraction is the walk between the cliffs at low tide when a variety of rock formations and caves of amazing natural beauty are exposed. During high tide the beach disappears almost entirely under the waves. Natural tunnels are only seen during low tide. Due to the growing popularity of Cathedral Beaches, reservations are now required during the summer months.</p>
